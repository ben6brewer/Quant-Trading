fity week moving average:
-   higher sharpe and return than just holding
-   low number of trades (2 per cycle)

crypto sentiment:
-   works alright but I might be overfitting the data by adding a variable for how long
    it needs to have print after print in the threshold. Adding one for the buy and the 
    sell to have their own timeframe is probably overfitting

vix strategies:
-   works well to identify good buying opportunities but is not worth trading
    the opportunity cost of holding cash to buy the vix spike is not worth the gains

Ideas:
- buy all stocks according to their size and rebalance every month
- moving average permutations
- long / short specific decile in SP500 according to KPI metrics like PE ratio
- go long / short when the bollinger bands compress and set stop losses
