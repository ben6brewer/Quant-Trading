fity week moving average:
-   higher sharpe and return than just holding
-   low number of trades (2 per cycle)

crypto sentiment:
-   works alright but I might be overfitting the data by adding a variable for how long
    it needs to have print after print in the threshold. Adding one for the buy and the 
    sell to have their own timeframe is probably overfitting
